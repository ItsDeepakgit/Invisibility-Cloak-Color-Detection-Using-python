# Invisibility-Cloak-Color-Detection-Using-python
This repository contains the implementation of invisibility cloak.This project is developed using OpenCv and numpy libraries.
# Objective
This project inspired by Harry Potter's invisible cloak. We use hsv colors space which is Hue Saturation Value. This makes it easier when we are working on or need luminance.
1. It's a fun application which you will enjoy using.
2. You can learn some key functions of OpenCV from this project.
# Minimum Requirements
This code is written in Python(Python3) 
- Numpy package libraries installed
- OpenCV package libraries installed
- time
# Features
- It works based on background detection and color detection.
- You can adjust the colors of the cloak by changing the H value of lower & upper red limits.In this code we have taken red coloured cloak so the value is from 10 - 170.
- First show the webcam towards the background as it is the mask1 of the code and then show the cloak as it is the mask2 of the code.
